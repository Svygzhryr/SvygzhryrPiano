Pretty simple online piano app with intuitive design and decent functionality including multiple synths (and a sampler), envelope editing, reverb and octave changer, and 'hold' option. Moreover, there is some color themes and a text switch.

For the best performance I suggest using Mozilla Firefox browser. However, the app runs fine in other browsers as well.
